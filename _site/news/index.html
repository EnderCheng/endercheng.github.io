<p>Social media has recently become an important platform for users to share news, express views, and post messages. However, due to user privacy preservation in social media, many privacy setting tools are employed, which inevitably change the patterns and dynamics of information dissemination. In this study, a general stochastic model using dynamic evolution equations was introduced to illustrate how privacy concerns impact the process of information dissemination. Extensive simulations and analyzes involving the privacy settings of general users, privileged users, and pure observers were conducted on real-world networks, and the results demonstrated that user privacy settings affect information differently. Finally, we also studied the process of information diffusion analytically and numerically with different privacy settings using two classic networks.</p>

<p>With the pervasiveness of smartphones, mobile e-Healthcare has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Disease risk prediction, as it can assist in predicting user’s disease with big data analytics techniques, has become one of important topics in the field of e-Healthcare. However, if the privacy issue is not well addressed, disease risk predication cannot step into its flourish. Aiming at addressing this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving pre-clinical guidance scheme, called PGuide, which offers self-diagnosis service to medical users in a privacy-preserving way. In specific, to motivate medical users to provide more detailed health profile for accurate disease risk prediction, we introduce a privacy-preserving comparison protocol PPCP in the PGuide scheme. As a result, with enough health profile information offered by the medical users, the accuracy of disease risk prediction can be improved. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed PGuide scheme ensures the privacy-preservation for both medical users and service provider. In addition, the performance evaluation via extensive experiments also demonstrates that our proposed PPCP protocol is much efficient in terms of low computational cost and communication overhead.</p>

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving set aggregation scheme for smart grid communications. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing a group G of composite order n = pq to achieve two-subset aggregation from a single aggregated data. With the proposed set aggregation scheme, the control center in smart grid is able to obtain more fine-grained data aggregation results for better monitoring and controlling smart grid. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy-preserving with formal proof under random oracle model. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted, the results demonstrate the proposed scheme is also efficient in terms of low computational costs and communication overheads.</p>

<p>In big data era, the explosive data mining techniques are used as popular tools to mine useful knowledge for the hospitals.
However, considering the complexity of these techniques, the hospitals tend to outsource both data and calculations to
computationally powerful cloud, which however poses a potential threat to user’s privacy. In this paper, in order to address the privacy challenge, based on Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem, we propose a feasible privacy-preserving single-layer perceptron scheme, named PSLP. Specifically, in the proposed PSLP scheme, a hospital outsources the sensitive medical information to the cloud in ciphertext, and then the cloud can execute the privacypreserving neural network training to obtain the disease model. Detailed security analysis shows the proposed PSLP can really achieve privacy-preserving property. In addition, extensive performance evaluations also demonstrate it is feasible in terms of computational cost and communication overhead.</p>

<p>With the explosive growth of data and the advance of cloud computing, data mining technology has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of data mining technology still faces many challenges in big data era, and one of the main security issues is to prevent privacy disclosure when running data mining in cloud. In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible protocol, called EFPA, for privacy-preserving association rule mining in cloud. With the protocol, plenty of participants can provide their data and mine the association rules in cloud together without privacy leakage. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EFPA protocol can achieve privacy-preserving mining of association rules in cloud. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the EFPA’s effectiveness in term of low computational costs.</p>
