<p>With the development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has been proposed to bring essential and potential benefits, such as improving traffic safety and offering computational services to road users. To make such computational services reliable and secure, the computation results from the vehicular cloud (VC) should be verifiable and the trustworthy vehicles need to be selected to form the VC with disclosure-minimizing privacy. To address these challenges, a privacy-preserving trust-based verifiable vehicular cloud computing scheme has been proposed in this paper, named PTVC. Specifically, the proposed PTVC scheme integrates the unique features of VCC and the requirements of privacy into traditional reputation system based on beta distribution, which can help differentiate the trust levels of the vehicles and preserve location privacy in the meantime. Moreover, by using the verifiable techniques, the cloud users can verify the correctness of outsourced computation while guaranteeing the privacy of their outsourced data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PTVC scheme is secure and robust against several sophisticated attacks. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations are also conducted, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2016/06/PTRS">A Privacy-Preserving Trust-based Relay Selection Scheme in VANETs (PTRS)</a></h3>

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>As one of the essential components of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) plays a significant role in enabling various on-road applications, most of which primarily rely on two-hop Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communications. To make such communications reliable and secure, it is significant to ensure that only the trustworthy vehicles are selected as relays. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a robust trust-based relay selection scheme, called PTRS, which, based on Dirichlet distribution, systematically integrates a set of unique features of VANET, e.g., hybrid architecture, high dynamics, into the traditional reputation system, with an objective to effectively differentiate the trust levels of the vehicles, meanwhile, preserving robustness. Besides, the location privacy of vehicles are preserved in our proposed scheme by using the technique of pseudonyms and trust levels instead of explicit reputation scores. Detailed security analysis is
conducted, which shows that the proposed PTRS scheme is secure and robust against several sophisticated attacks in VANETs. In addition, a set of extensive simulations are carried out, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2016/06/TripSense">A Trust-based Vehicular Platoon Crowdsensing Scheme with Privacy Preservation in VANETs (TripSense)</a></h3>
        <span class="index_date"> 01 June 2016</span>

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>In this paper, we propose a trust-based vehicular platoon crowdsensing scheme, named as TripSense, in VANET. The proposed TripSense scheme introduces a trust-based system to evaluate vehicles’ sensing abilities and then selects those more capable vehicles in order to improve sensing results accuracy. Besides, the sensing tasks are accomplished by platoon member vehicles and preprocessed by platoon head vehicles before the data are uploaded to server. Hence it is less time-consuming and more efficient compared with the way where the data are submitted by individual platoon member vehicles. Hence it is more suitable in ephemeral network like VANET. Moreover, our proposed TripSense scheme integrates unlinkable pseudo-ID technique to achieve PMvehicle identity privacy, and employs a privacy-preserving sensing vehicle selection scheme without involving the PM vehicle’s trust score to keep its location privacy. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed TripSense scheme not only achieves desirable privacy requirements but also resists against attacks launched by adversaries. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to show the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2016/02/FSSR">Fine-Grained EHRs Sharing via Similarity-Based Recommendation in Cloud-Assisted eHealthcare System (FSSR)</a></h3>
        <span class="index_date"> 02 February 2016</span>

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>With the evolving of ehealthcare industry, electronic health records (EHRs), as one of the digital health records stored and managed by patients, have been regarded to provide more benefits, especially considering that patients can easily and conveniently share health records with doctors and build up a complete picture of their health. However, due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of EHRs, how to guarantee the security and privacy of EHRs when sharing becomes one of most important issues concerned by patients. To tackle these privacy challenges such as how to make a fine-grained access control on the shared EHRs, how to keep the confidentiality of EHRs stored in cloud, how to audit EHRs for patients and how to find the suitable doctors, in this paper, we propose a new fine-grained EHRs sharing scheme via similarity-based recommendation accelerated by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in cloud-assisted ehealthcare system, called FSSR, which allows a patient to securely share his/her EHRs with some suitable doctors under fine-grained privacy access control. In addition, we also conduct extensive simulations by developing a prototype of FSSR, and the performance evaluations demonstrate the FSSR’s effectiveness in terms of computational cost, storage and communication cost while minimizing the privacy disclosure.</p>

        <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>With the ubiquity of mobile devices, location-based social networking applications have been widely used in people’s daily life. However, due to the importance and sensitivity of location information, these applications may lead to serious security issues for user’s location privacy. To handle these location privacy challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving proximity testing scheme, called EPPD, for location-based services. With EPPD, a group of users can test whether they are within a given distance with minimal privacy disclosure. In specific, EPPD is comprised of two phases: first, users periodically upload their encrypted locations to service provider; and later, users can send requests to service provider for proximity testing and obtain the final testing results. Detailed security analysis shows that EPPD can achieve privacy-preserving proximity testing. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EPPD in term of low computational cost and communication overhead.</p>
