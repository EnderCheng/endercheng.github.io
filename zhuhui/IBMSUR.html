						<h4>Project Overview</h4>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Cloud data outsourcing and query, due to its potential advantages over distributed data storage and fusion, e.g., compatibility to Big Data, efficiency and mobility, has received considerable attentions in recent years. However, as the current researches of data outsourcing and query have not thoroughly understood or addressed potential risks and realistic threats of privacy disclosure in cloud based data applications, there is still a long way to persuade the government and industry to put data outsourcing and retrieval technique into practice. To fill this gap, this proposed project will investigate a set of practical privacy-protection techniques to enhance privacy-preservation in real-world data outsourcing, i.e., secure searchable encryption with complex arithmetic operations, secure range query and ranked search over encrypted data. The proposed research project will also address the significant technical challenges, including capability of complex operations over encrypted data, energy-efficiency of data outsourcing, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The project will help to better understand the security challenges of cloud computing techniques when applied in real scenarios. The practical privacy enhanced techniques to be developed are critical to the success of cloud computing techniques deployed in real smart city, big data and Internet of Things era. To better make use of the project in IBM, a strong team from IBM GCG System & Technology Labs (Xi’an) will work closely with Xidian University. Due to well addressing the real cyber-security and privacy problems that people mostly concern, this project will result in significant benefits to IBM by gaining user confidence in its cloud product, and help IBM to attract users with privacy concerns in various fields, e.g., medical, logistics and finance. Moreover, by utilizing IBM Platform Symphony as test bed, it is expected that the existing ongoing research will be studied more extensively and comprehensively, and lead to a fruitful collaboration result.

						<h4><a href="http://ste.xidian.edu.cn/zhuhui/EPQ/">1. An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Location Based Services Query Scheme for Smart Phone</a></h4>
						<p>
							With the pervasiveness of location-aware mobile electronic devices and the advances of wireless communication, location based services (LBS), which can help people enjoy convenient life, has attracted considerable interests recently. However, the privacy issues of LBS are still challenging today. Aiming at the challenges, in this paper, we present a new efficient and privacy-preserving LBS query scheme, named EPQ, for pervasive smart phones. In EPQ scheme, the LBS provider's data are first outsourced to the cloud server, and later the registered user can get accurate LBS query results without divulging his/her location information to the LBS provider and cloud server. Specifically, based on an improved homomorphic encryption technology over composite order group, a special spatial range query algorithm SRQC in ciphertext is proposed, with which EPQ achieves privacy preservation of user's query and confidentiality of LBS data in the outsourced cloud server. Through detailed security analysis, we show that EPQ can resist various security threats. In addition, we also implement EPQ over a smart phone and three workstations with a real LBS dataset. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the EPQ scheme is highly efficient at smart phone side and can be implemented effectively in the cloud server.

						<h4><a href="http://ste.xidian.edu.cn/zhuhui/ediag/">2. Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Online Medical Pre-Diagnosis Framework Using Nonlinear SVM</a></h4>
						<p>
							With the advances of machine learning algorithms and the pervasiveness of network terminals, online medical pre-diagnosis system, which can provide the diagnosis of healthcare provider anywhere anytime, has attracted considerable interest recently. However, the flourish of online medical pre-diagnosis system still faces many challenges including information security and privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online medical pre-diagnosis framework, called EDiag, by using nonlinear kernel support vector machine (SVM). With EDiag, the sensitive personal health information can be processed without privacy disclosure during online pre-diagnosis service. Specifically, based on an improved expression for the nonlinear SVM, an efficient and privacy-preserving classification scheme is introduced with lightweight multi-party random masking and polynomial aggregation techniques. The encrypted user query is directly operated at the service provider without decryption, and the diagnosis result can only be decrypted by user. Through extensive analysis, we show that EDiag can ensure that user's health information and healthcare provider's prediction model are without leakage, and has significantly less computation and communication overhead than existing schemes. In addition, performance evaluations via implementing EDiag on smartphone and computer demonstrate EDiag's effectiveness in term of real online environment.

						<h4><a href="http://ste.xidian.edu.cn/zhuhui/EPCS/">3.An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Classification Service Query Framework for SVM</a></h4>
						<p>
							The support vector machine (SVM) classification, which can handle large data sets in high dimensional spaces, has been used in numerous settings nowadays, such as genetic match, spam detection, and financial prediction. Due to the data's sensitivity and classifiers' confidentiality, how to provide privacy-preserving SVM classification has attracted considerable interests recently. Aiming at the privacy issues, in this paper, we present an efficient and privacy-preserving classification service query framework, named EPCS, for the linear kernel SVM classifier. Specifically, based on lightweight multi-party random masking and polynomial aggregation techniques, EPCS achieves privacy preservation of users' data and SVM classifier efficiently during the process of user query. Through detailed security analysis, we show that EPCS can resist various security threats. In addition, we implement EPCS in Java, and evaluate EPCS over a smart phone and a PC. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the EPCS scheme can indeed achieve efficient and effective SVM classification.

						<h4><a href="http://chenghuang.info/zhuhui/Polaris">4.Efficient and Privacy-preserving Polygons Spatial Query Framework for Location-based Services</a></h4>
						<p>
							The pervasiveness of location-based mobile devices has greatly promoted the development of the location-based service. The polygons spatial query in outsourced cloud which is one of the major technologies of the location-based service has attracted considerable interests recently. However, the polygons spatial query still faces many challenges including spatial information security and privacy preservation. In this paper,we proposed an efficient and privacy-preserving polygons spatial query framework for location-based services, called Polaris. With Polaris, the data owner first outsourced the encrypted spatial information to cloud, and then the registered user can query any convex range (not confined to the circular or rectangle traditionally) and get accurate results without divulging his/her query information to the data owner and cloud. Specifically, an improved homomorphic encryption technology over composite order group is employed to construct a special polygon spatial (convex) query algorithm (SPSQ), which achieves the privacy preservation of users query information, the security of the LBS data outsourced to cloud and the accuracy of spatial range query results. Detailed secure analysis shows that our proposed Polaris can resist various security threats. In addition, Polaris framework is implemented over a smart phone, two workstations with real spatial dataset, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Polaris framework is highly efficient at smart phone and can be implemented effectively in the cloud server.
