### Abstract
With the evolving of ehealthcare industry, electronic health records (EHRs), as one of the digital health records stored and managed by patients, have been regarded to provide more benefits, especially considering that patients can easily and conveniently share health records with doctors and build up a complete picture of their health. However, due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of EHRs, how to guarantee the security and privacy of EHRs when sharing becomes one of most important issues concerned by patients. To tackle these privacy challenges such as how to make a fine-grained access control on the shared EHRs, how to keep the confidentiality of EHRs stored in cloud, how to audit EHRs for patients and how to find the suitable doctors, in this paper, we propose a new fine-grained EHRs sharing scheme via similarity-based recommendation accelerated by Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) in cloud-assisted ehealthcare system, called FSSR, which allows a patient to securely share his/her EHRs with some suitable doctors under fine-grained privacy access control. In addition, we also conduct extensive simulations by developing a prototype of FSSR, and the performance evaluations demonstrate the FSSR's effectiveness in terms of computational cost, storage and communication cost while minimizing the privacy disclosure.
