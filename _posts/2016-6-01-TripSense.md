### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a trust-based vehicular platoon crowdsensing scheme, named as TripSense, in VANET. The proposed TripSense scheme introduces a trust-based system to evaluate vehicles' sensing abilities and then selects those more capable vehicles in order to improve sensing results accuracy. Besides, the sensing tasks are accomplished by platoon member vehicles and preprocessed by platoon head vehicles before the data are uploaded to server. Hence it is less time-consuming and more efficient compared with the way where the data are submitted by individual platoon member vehicles. Hence it is more suitable in ephemeral network like VANET. Moreover, our proposed TripSense scheme integrates unlinkable pseudo-ID technique to achieve PMvehicle identity privacy, and employs a privacy-preserving sensing vehicle selection scheme without involving the PM vehicleâ€™s trust score to keep its location privacy. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed TripSense scheme not only achieves desirable privacy requirements but also resists against attacks launched by adversaries. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to show the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed scheme.
