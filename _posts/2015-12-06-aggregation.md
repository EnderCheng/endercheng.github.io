### Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving set aggregation scheme for smart grid communications. The proposed scheme is characterized by employing a group G of composite order n = pq to achieve two-subset aggregation from a single aggregated data. With the proposed set aggregation scheme, the control center in smart grid is able to obtain more fine-grained data aggregation results for better monitoring and controlling smart grid. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy-preserving with formal proof under random oracle model. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted, the results demonstrate the proposed scheme is also efficient in terms of low computational costs and communication overheads.
