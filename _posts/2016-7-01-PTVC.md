### Abstract
With the development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), vehicular cloud computing (VCC) has been proposed to bring essential and potential benefits, such as improving traffic safety and offering computational services to road users. To make such computational services reliable and secure, the computation results from the vehicular cloud (VC) should be verifiable and the trustworthy vehicles need to be selected to form the VC with disclosure-minimizing privacy. To address these challenges, a privacy-preserving trust-based verifiable vehicular cloud computing scheme has been proposed in this paper, named PTVC. Specifically, the proposed PTVC scheme integrates the unique features of VCC and the requirements of privacy into traditional reputation system based on beta distribution, which can help differentiate the trust levels of the vehicles and preserve location privacy in the meantime. Moreover, by using the verifiable techniques, the cloud users can verify the correctness of outsourced computation while guaranteeing the privacy of their outsourced data. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PTVC scheme is secure and robust against several sophisticated attacks. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations are also conducted, demonstrating its effectiveness.
